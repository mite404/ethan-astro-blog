# _"The Mountain and the Map: Week One Revelations"_

On Monday I packed up my gear, my existing JavaScript, Python and a small bit of Typescript knowledge and started off on the trail that leads to the bottom of the mountain.

It’s been a long time since I tried to learn something with a very minimal amount of pre-existing knowledge – maybe even not since college, 19 years ago. I felt like I encountered the visibility paradox early on on Monday & Tuesday. The more I realized I didn’t know as much as I thought I did, the larger the mountain became. “When will I even see the other side of it?” I worried to myself. But as the week went on and I had some wins (standing up my backend server quicker than I thought it’d take me and doing it while using a pkg I’m unfamiliar with, Vite-Express) the more I realized that I actually do know some things, learning was fun, being challenged was exhilarating and the knowledge gained is sometimes more powerful than the end result.

I enjoyed gaining a deeper understanding of the separation of concerns and building pure functions. I was able to take the final steps into understanding the state as a concept rather than something that a React hook can output. An important lesson that was unclear up until that point was: Rendering state isn’t necessarily the same as the state that your program is in.

_What knowledge did I gain this week then?_

I started to feel like I was thinking like an engineer rather than thinking about _“learning the syntax of TypeScript"_ or _"learning how to use React hooks”_ was of greater importance. Learning how problem solving, sketching out your mental model, then testing it against what your building _was_ the win.
