# _Off Balance_

This week I was faced with a realization: two things were contributing to losing some fundamental fluency with JavaScript.

First, my part time job as a bicycle courier was eating up every spare hour I had to integrate
some of the concepts I'd learned that week into some study sessions. Second, our
weekly projects are so invovled that I haven't had a moment to continue practicing the basics
mixed in with the freshly learned concepts.

All week we had drills, bug fix tasks, puzzle functions and system design tests.
If I passed I could start using AI agents to help iterate on projects faster.
I didn't pass the bug fix, level 1 or level 2 tasks on the first try.
The system design was easier for me, but the nested data type puzzles exposed my rusty brain.

I wasn't mad at the drills. I enjoyed learning and thought this week was better
than last week's group projects, even. However, I was disappointed to see something
I knew 4-8 weeks ago fall through my hands like tiny grains of sand on a hot beach
littered with disappointments. The fluency I'd worked so hard to build was slipping already!

Needless to say this week I took a leave from my part-time job. I hadn't had a day off in four weeks.
My job was also pulling some bullshit with the scheduling so, to be honest
all in all it was a WIN-WIN for me.

## _What I Built Instead_

> "You can't record music once every three to four years and think that's going to be enough" - Daniel Ek, Spotify CEO

Daniel Ek sucks. His VC firm, Prima Materia, has been the primary investor in Helsing,
an AI-powered military drones and battlefield analysis software maker.
I'm glad I solved this problem, implemented the feature and can end my support of Spotify & Daniel Ek.
Sure, I didn't pass every drill this week. But I practiced, took some actionable steps to
increase my available study time and built something that matters to me.
