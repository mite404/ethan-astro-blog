# _Finding My Balance_

This week was tough. I wanted to prove to myself that I could finish a Level 2
Assignment despite the AI and other students telling me these contained some senior
level complexity. _"That's 3-4 layers of abstraction at once,"_ it said. _"You’re
trying to solve five puzzles at once, while writing code cleanly enough to pass
tests - That’s a senior-level compositional skill,"_ it said. Each time I wanted
to beat it like an extra hard Dark Souls boss. I didn't care and I wanted to win.
_"Surely I can just brute force it,"_ I said to myself.

AI even told me to stop at one point, lol.

> _"Before I help you debug, I want to check in: **you've been working on this assignment for a while now.** How are you feeling? Are you getting frusterated?_ - Claude

With the help of the instructor's advice I decided to take a break and try and
build something, anything instead. At first I focused on using AI tools because
that's what the intention for that week was, but I wanted to build
something on my own without AI. I wanted to regain some confidence I'd lost in
the last 2 weeks full of tricky evals.

I wanted to try my hand at building a Raycast extension since I had no experience
building something besides a 'web app.' I focused on two things:

- something I'm passionate about (music)
- something smaller and less daunting in scope

The intention was to focus on _the act of building within the moment_ rather than
focusing on the outcome. Within three days I had more fun and felt more joy than
the previous 4 days of the week.

## _What I Built_

> _"You can contact a third-party agency and pay for an article about yourself
in Forbes."_ - Oobah Butler, BBC Journalist [(the article)](https://forbes.ge/en/digital-trickster-s-latest-projects/)

Within 3 days I had a working Raycast extension tested and deployed. I also
accomplished another goal of mine coming into this program: to contribute to
Open Source Software.
I'm amazed at how they designed their API to accept React and compile it into
Apple's UIKit for native OSX apps. I didn't have to worry about React Native or
learning a whole new framework. I learned more about the CI/CD process which was
one of my goals for this program too.
